LIRAPAY isn’t just an average fintech company. Our team is composed of finance experts that come from a long line of bankers. Innovation and excellence are our focus, so when we say we want to set the new standard for new digital financial services, we mean it.

LIRAPAY’s history is the history of the Chrissoveloni family. This family has been in the banking business since 1848 when Zanni Chrissoveloni set up its first financial services office in a Romanian port on the Danube.
From there, the Chrissoveloni family legacy of banking grew to be an important contributor to the industrial development of Romania in 1889 and a multinational bank network with offices in New York, Paris, Vienna, and Constantinople in 1920.
Then along came John Chrissovelni who founded PayNet SRL, which eventually led to LIRAPAY.

A past history of banking doesn’t mean much if it isn’t backed up by experience in the modern world, and in that regard, LIRAPAY’s team is more than covered.
This is the team that founded PayNet SRL in 1999, the first third-party processor in Romania.
PayNet quickly became a pioneer for Romania’s card industry, promoting new products and technologies in the market (first affinity co branded card with a Trade Union from Petrol and Gas Industry – 200.000 cards; first installment private label card – Card Avantaj for FinansBank, transformed into a VISA card, first private label ATMs network, etc).
Paynet served as processors for small and medium banks in Romania, Serbia, Montenegro, and Cyprus, and in 2011 they were integrated into one of the biggest worldwide processors.
And then in 2018, we took all that experience and launched LIRAPAY.
